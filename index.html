<p><tt>waitingworship.org</tt> offers an online version of the
centuries-old Quaker tradition of <em>waiting worship</em>.  In
waiting worship, individuals gather in expectant silence, waiting for
the prompting of the Holy Spirit.  That Spirit may inspire a message
to share with those gathered.  Waiting worship can be a profound and
remarkable experience and is an important component of how Quakers
(also called Friends) practice their faith and discernment.</p>

<p>I created <tt>waitingworship.org</tt> in order to make it easier
for Friends (and friends) to worship when separated by distance or
immersed in busy and fruitful lives.  Accessible from any web device
&mdash; computer, smart phone, tablet, etc &mdash; the site tries to
recreate essential aspects of the experience of waiting worship.  I
leave it to G*d and the Holy Spirit to create the rest.</p>

<p>Worship at <tt>waitingworship.org</tt> is organized
around <strong>worship spaces</strong> created by individuals or
organizations.  Joining a worship space begins by directing your
device's browser to a particular web address; you'll see the name of
the worship space and a list of the individuals gathered there.  Type
your name in the text field and press Enter.  In some cases, you may
need to enter a "knock phrase" to enter worship.  If you
have <em>validated an email address</em> for your device, you can
notify others that you are settling into worship.</p>

<p>You're encouraged to expand the browser to fill the screen and to
turn off any distracting notifications.  To leave worship, simply
leave the page, either by closing the window or switching to another
activity on your device.</p>

<p>In the worship space, you'll see an indication of who is joined
with you in worship and any recent message, if there is one.  There
are two buttons on the page: one returns you to the entry page where
you began; the other allows you to "speak" in the space by typing a
message.  Messages are spaced out, so if you type a message, it may
not be visible immediately.</p>
