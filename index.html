<h1>Waiting Worship</h1>

<p><tt>waitingworship.org</tt> tries to create an online version of
the centuries-old Quaker tradition of <em>waiting worship</em>.  In
waiting worship, individuals gather in silence, waiting for the
prompting of the Holy Spirit with a message to share with those
gathered.  It can be a profound and remarkable experience and is an
important component of how Quakers (also called Friends) worship.</p>

<p>I created <tt>waitingworship.org</tt> in order to make it easier
for Friends (and friends) to worship when separated by distance or
immersed in their busy and fruitful lives.  Accessible from any web
device &emdash; computer, smart phone, tablet, etc &emdash; the site
tries to recreate some of the essential experience of waiting worship
as practiced by Friends.  I leave it to G*d and the Holy Spirit to
create the rest.</p>

<p>Worship at <tt>waitingworship.org</tt> is organized
around <strong>worship spaces</strong> created by individuals or
organizations.  Joining a worship space begins by directing your
device's browser to a particular web address; you'll see the name of
the worship space and a list of the individuals gathered there.  Type
your name in the text field and press Enter.  In some cases, you may
need to enter a "knock phrase" to enter worship.  If you
have <em>validated an email address</em> for your device, you can
notify others that you are settling into worship.</p>

<p>You're encouraged to expand the browser to fill the screen and to
turn off any distracting notifications.  To leave worship, simply
leave the page, either by closing the window or switching to another
activity on your device.</p>

<p>In the worship space, you'll see an indication of who is joined
with you in worship and any recent message, if there is one.  There
are two buttons on the page: one returns you to the entry page where
you began; the other allows you to "speak" in the space by typing a
message.  Messages are spaced out, so if you type a message, it may
not be visible immediately.</p>
